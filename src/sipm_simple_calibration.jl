    sipm_simple_calibration(pe_uncal::Array)

Perform a simple calibration for the uncalibrated p.e. spectrum array `pe_uncal`
using just the 1 p.e. and 2 p.e. peak positions estimated by a peakfinder.

Inputs:
    * `pe_uncal`: array of uncalibrated peak amplitudes
kwargs:
    * `expect_noise_peak`: bool value stating whether noise peak exists in the uncalibrated spectrum or not
    * `initial_min_amp`: uncalibrated amplitude value as a left boundary to build the uncalibrated histogram where the peak search is performed on.
                        For the peak search with noise peak, this value is consecutively increased i.o.t exclude the noise peak from the histogram.
    * `initial_max_quantile`: quantile of the uncalibrated amplitude array to used as right boundary to build the uncalibrated histogram
    * `step_size_min_amp`: only for if noise peak exists, this gives the step size for the minimal amplitude increase, to exclude the noise peak from the uncalibrated histogram eventually
    * `peakfinder_σ`: sigma value in number of bins for peakfinder
    * `peakfinder_threshold`: threshold value for peakfinder

Returns 
    * `pe_simple_cal`: array of the calibrated pe array with the simple calibration
    * `func`: function to use for the calibration
    * `c`: calibration factor
    * `peakpos`: 1 p.e. and 2 p.e. peak positions in uncalibrated amplitude
    * `h_uncal`: histogram of the uncalibrated pe array
    * `h_calsimple`: histogram of the calibrated pe array with the simple calibration
